    "1. Changes over time in the base from which growth is measured. Such changes might include increases in the number of stores, markets or salespeople generating sales. This issue is addressed by using “same store” measures (or corollary measures for markets, sales personnel and so on).\n",
    "2. Compounding of growth over multiple periods. For example, if a company achieves 30% growth in one year, but its results remain unchanged over the two subsequent years, this would not be the same as 10% growth in each of three years.
