    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive way to solve the problem of finding the percentile is to concatenate arrays ***a*** and ***b*** and sort them and display the required percentile by the *original rank* ***k*** of the sorted array. But such an method will have high time complexity.  \n",
    "Therefore, we will take advantage of the fact that the arrays are sorted and implement the percentile search algorithm using the ideas of the binary search algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To search for a percentile, we need to find the k-th element corresponding to this percentile. To do this, we will select a range of length ***k*** in arrays ***a*** and ***b***, where ***k*** is ordinal rank for percentile ***P***:  \n",
    "**k = (len(a) + len(b)) * P / 100**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we take the same left sides of arrays ***a*** and ***b***, the total length of which will be ***k***.\n",
    "This way each array will be split into 2 parts. And we get two pairs of parts - left and right.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then we compare the left and right parts - if both left parts are less than the right ones, then our desired percentile is found, as a maximum from the right boundaries of the left parts of arrays ***a*** and ***b***.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To compare the left and right sides, we can use the knowledge that our arrays are sorted. We can compare only the borders of these parts - the right borders of the left parts (*left_a, left_b*) with the left borders of the right ones (*right_a, right_b*) (a bit confusing, but I think the inspectors know this algorithm well, and will skim this explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If one of the right borders of the left side is larger than the left border of the left side, then we will increase the border of the second left side using a binary search approach. Then we will have to reduce the second left part so that the total length of the both left parts remains equal to the ordinal rank ***k***.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We will do this adjustment until the conditions for inequality of the boundaries are satisfied. And then we will stop our loop, since the desired percentile is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the complexity of our algorithm will be **O(log(n))**, where ***n*** is size of array ***a***.\n",
